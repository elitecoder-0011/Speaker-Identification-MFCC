# Speaker Identification System Using MFCC

**OVERVIEW:** 
The Speaker Identification System uses machine learning to identify speakers based on unique audio features. By using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction and classification algorithms, the system can accurately identify speakers from audio inputs. This project addresses the growing demand for speaker recognition in applications such as security, voice authentication, and human-computer interaction.

**METHODOLOGY:**

+ **Feature Extraction**
    - Extract MFCC features using the Librosa library.
    - Compute delta and delta-delta coefficients for capturing dynamic information.
    - Aggregate mean values for feature robustness and noise reduction.
    
+ **Machine Learning Model**
    - Preprocess audio features with StandardScaler for normalization.
    - Use algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks for classification.
    - Apply label encoding to map speakers to their identities.
    
+ **Web Application**
    - Flask-based web interface for file uploads and predictions.
    - Ngrok is used for generating public-facing URLs for remote access.
    - Responsive design ensures usability across various devices.

**CONCLUSION:** 
The Speaker Identification System demonstrates the potential of machine learning in audio processing. It provides accurate speaker recognition, a user-friendly web interface, and scalability for future enhancements. With improvements like deep learning integration and multilingual support, the system can cater to broader applications in authentication, security, and assistive technologies.
